   		<div id="introduction-text">
   			<p>Newly appearing or newly established weed species in a region. They were previously absent, or present only in limited numbers, with a very recent spreadness or with a high potential to spread in the near future. Their occurrence can happen due to various factors, like changes in land use, agricultural practices, environmental conditions or the introduction of invasive plant species from other regions. During the early stages the costs and efforts to manage them can be highly reduced, resulting also in lower economic and ecological impacts.

   			<p>In agricultural habitats weeds are one of the main pests. It has been estimated a loss of around 30 billion dollars globally each year, split up between crop yeld losses (competition and/or disease spreadness), human impact (allergies), livestock impact (toxicity) and natural habitats impact (biodiversity loss).</p>

   		<div id="project-text">
   			<p>AgriWeedClim aims to identify emerging weeds in Europe, estimate the future suitable areas and the potential impacts and finally to find management methods to reduce their impact. Currently we are at the first stage of data analysis, checking for historical weed community changes and the identification of emerging weed species.<br>
   			More precisely the aims of my research is to obtain a list of likely emerging weeds, gather and standardize the data on the selected species and finally to get the first conclusions by looking at possible patterns and particular traits.</p>
